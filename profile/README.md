## What we do

MoradaUno combines **workflow software + verification + legal tooling + risk protection** to help teams close rentals in days—not weeks.

- **Tenant screening & verification** (identity, credit & risk signals, etc.)
- **Contract generation & e-signature workflows**
- **Rent protection** (coverage for missed payments, backed processes)
- **Private mediation & legal assistance**
- **Home insurance options** built for rentals

> Our platform is designed to help advisors operate with speed and confidence, and help landlords protect income and property.

## The product (from a tech lens)

We think of MoradaUno as an **end-to-end rental operating system**:

### 1) Intake & Identity
- User onboarding (advisor / landlord / tenant)
- Identity and document capture pipelines
- Fraud and anomaly checks

### 2) Risk & Screening
- Multi-source evaluation (credit + background + public signals)
- Rules + scoring for decision support
- Audit trails and explainable outputs for users and internal teams

### 3) Contracts & Signing
- Contract templates and clause logic
- Variable extraction and validation
- E-signature and evidence-grade recordkeeping

### 4) Operations & Payments
- Case-based operations tracking
- Reminders, renewals, and operational milestones
- Integrations for payment collection flows (where applicable)

### 5) Protection, Mediation & Legal Workflows
- Event-driven triggers (late payment, breach scenarios)
- Guided resolution flows
- Case management and documentation for mediation / legal follow-up

## Engineering principles

We optimize for:

- **Reliability**: predictable outcomes, observable systems, strong SLO thinking
- **Security & privacy**: least privilege, encrypted secrets, secure document handling
- **Auditability**: everything important is traceable (who/what/when/why)
- **Speed with safety**: ship fast, but protect customers with layered validation
- **Modularity**: services that can evolve independently without breaking operations

---
